## Synopsis

This is a collection of small codes to send data and test connections.

## Motivation

Most of these are used in one part or another. All of them are for educational purpose.

## Installation

Whoever wants to use these codes must have a good understanding about his own creation. These parts must be integrated manually. </BR>
If there is a need to discuss things, be sure to understand the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model). In my opinion it is one of the most essential things. Experience is needed, too.
